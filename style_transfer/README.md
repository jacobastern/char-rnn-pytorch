# Style Transfer - Tensorflow 2.0
This is a project demoing the Tensorflow 2.0 style transfer tutorial. My purpose in this project was primarily to familiarize myself with TF 2.0, so most of the code is shamelessly copied verbatim from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/generative/style_transfer). I've added comments and docstrings and rewritten the Jupyter Notebook as a python program that can be run from the command line.
